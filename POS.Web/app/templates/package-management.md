# Package Management

[NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/) is used to manage developer tools and libraries. Most of these are used for compilation of the various project assets. These are managed in `package.json` and stored in `node_modules`.

[Bower](http://bower.io) is used to manage 3rd party, client-side libraries such as Angular, jQuery, and Bootstrap. These are managed in `bower.json` and stored in `vendor/bower`.
