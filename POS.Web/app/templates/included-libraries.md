# Included Libraries

The starter kit includes several carefully-chosen libraries that will help you jumpstart development of your application. It may feel a bit heavy to some, but it is quite easy to remove the ones you don't care for.

### Javascript

* [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) - Of course. This is is the only required library. The others can be removed. See the documentation on the build system for more info.
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) - DOM manipulation utility
* [lodash](http://lodash.com/) - Utility library and drop-in replacement for Underscore.js
* [UI-Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) - Better routing system than Angular's default router. Allows nested routes, among other features.
* [UI-Bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/) - Bootstrap components written in pure Angular rather than jQuery

### Styling

* [Bootstrap-Sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/) - Nice sest of default styles for quickly scaffolding a new site. The individual modules can be disabled in `app/css/_bootstrap_modules.scss`
* [Font-Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) - A set of scalable and customizable vector icons.
